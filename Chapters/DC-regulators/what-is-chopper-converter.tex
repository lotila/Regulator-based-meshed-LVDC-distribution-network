A chopper converter is a type of electronic circuit that is used to convert fixed DC voltage to variable DC voltage, usually by chopping a DC input voltage into a train of pulses. The process of chopping is achieved by rapidly switching a device, such as a transistor, on and off to control the output voltage. Essentialy a chopper is a pulse width modulated (PWM) switch.

Chopper converters are used in applications that non-constant power output doesnot  matter, like battery chargers and brushed DC motor speed controllers. For the example of battery charger, charging the battery in pulses or in constant power doesnot make a difference. The reason why chopper converter is used in battery charges is to prevent over heating and over changing of the battery. Similarly, in meshed DC grid, chopper converter could be used to prevent the power line conductors from over heating. DC power quality for customer might be decreased in this scenario.
