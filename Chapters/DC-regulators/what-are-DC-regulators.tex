Direct current regulator is an electronic circuit that is designed to control  current, even in the presence of changes in input voltage or load resistance. This is achieved by sensing the current flowing through and adjusting the current supplied to the load.

There are several different types of DC regulators, each with their own unique characteristics and applications. They can be separated into linear DC regulators and switch-mode DC regulators, based on how current is controlled.
