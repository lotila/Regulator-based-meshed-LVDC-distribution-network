The traditional LVAC distribution network is based on a unidirectional radial design, which limits the distributed energy resource (DER) integration. In contrast, a meshed LVDC distribution network is a multi-source, multi-load topology that allows bidirectional power flow and easy DER integration.

One of the key challenges in the implementation of meshed network is maintaining power flow control. This can be achieved by using a direct current (DC) regulators, which are a devices that can control the current and power flow.

The main objective of this paper is to design, simulate, and evaluate a regulator-based meshed DC network, and to investigate its performance under different operating conditions. The current regulator desgins discussed in this paper are suitable for low voltage only.
