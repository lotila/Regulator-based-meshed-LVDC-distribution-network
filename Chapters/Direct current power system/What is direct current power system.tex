Direct Current (DC) power systems are electrical power systems that utilize a constant voltage level, and are characterized by a steady and unidirectional flow of electric current. 

DC power systems can be classified into two types: low voltage DC power systems and high voltage DC power systems. Low voltage DC power systems have a voltage level of less than 1,500 V and are used in small electronic devices, and electric vehicles \cite{IEC60038}. High voltage DC power systems have a voltage level of more than 1,500 V and are mainly used in industrial applications, such as long-distance power transmission.
